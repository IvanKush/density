1) heterogeneous_queue is allocating a runtime type for raw allocations
2) added is<> on the runtime type. Add to the concept
3) check the try_consume's
4) check that threads release pages to the system
5) update the page allocator concept
6) optimize nonblocking put when the type is known at runtime
7) review density common (some functions are undocumented)
