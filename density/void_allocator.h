        The UntypedAllocator concept encapsulates an untyped memory allocation service, similar to the
            <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/Allocator">Allocator concept</a> defined by the standard, but untyped like
            <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/c/malloc">std::malloc</a>. UntypedAllocator supports over-alignment and alignment
            offset. UntypedAllocator is also similar to the class <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/memory_resource">
            std::pmr::memory_resource</a> (introduced in C++17), but is not polymorphic.

    /** This class encapsulates an untyped memory allocation service, modeling both the \ref UntypedAllocator_concept "UntypedAllocator"
        and \ref PagedAllocator_concept "PagedAllocator" concepts.

        void_allocator is stateless. Any instance of void_allocator compares equal to any instance of void_allocator. This implies that
        blocks and pages can be deallocated by any instance of void_allocator.

        \section Implementation
        void_allocator redirects block allocations to the language built-in operator new. Whenever the requested alignment
        is greater than alignof(std::max_align_t), void_allocator allocates an overhead whose size is the maximum between
        the requested alignment and sizeof(void*). \n

        Every thread is associated to a free-page cache. When a page is deallocated, if the cache has less than 4 pages,
        the page to deallocate is pushed in this cache. When a page allocation is requested, a page from the cache is returned (if any).
        Pushing/peeking to\from the cache is very fast, and does not require thread synchronization. \n
        Note: on win32 void_allocator is not redirecting page allocations to VirtualAlloc, since from several tests the latter resulted
        around ten times slower than the operator new.
