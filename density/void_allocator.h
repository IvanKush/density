        The UntypedAllocator concept encapsulates an untyped memory allocation service, similar to the
            <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/Allocator">Allocator concept</a> defined by the standard, but untyped like
            <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/c/malloc">std::malloc</a>. UntypedAllocator supports over-alignment and alignment
            offset. UntypedAllocator is also similar to the class <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/memory_resource">
            std::pmr::memory_resource</a> (introduced in C++17), but is not polymorphic.

        Anyway, since the address at \em i_alignment_offset will have \em n low-order zero bits (where <em>i_alignment = 1 << n</em>), if
        \em i_alignment_offset has \em m low-order zero bits (that is aligned to <em>1 << m</em>), then the address of the first byte
        of the block is aligned at least to <em>1 << min(n,m)</em>.

        The user is responsible to ensure that:
        - \em i_alignment must be greater than zero and an integer power of 2
        - \em i_alignment_offset must be less than or equal to \em i_size

            If the page has been already deallocated no undefined behavior occurs: the caller should detect this case
            and unpin the page immediately. Using a deallocated-then-pinned page in any other way other than unpinning
            (including accessing its content) causes undefined behavior. \n
            If the page is still allocated then the pin ensures that, while the page is pinned:
                - the content of the page is not altered by the allocator
                - the page is not returned by a call to allocate_page, try_allocate_page, allocate_page_zeroed or try_allocate_page_zeroed.
                - if the page gets deallocated with a call to allocate_page_zeroed or try_allocate_page_zeroed, the memory
                    may be still not zeroed.

            Every call to pin_page should be matched by a call to unpin_page by the same thread. A thread may pin the same page
            multiple times, provided that it unpins the page the same number of times.
