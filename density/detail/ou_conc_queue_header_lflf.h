            Warning: this is a low-level, internal, complex-to-use class. Don't use it directly, use concurrent_heterogeneous_queue and concurrent_function_queue instead.
            This class assumes that the user space starts from (this + 1) and ends to reinterpret_cast<char*>(this) + PAGE_SIZE.
            This class implements a concurrent lock-free multiple-consumers multiple-producers heterogeneous queue. This container is disposable,
            in the sense that it does not recycle the space in the buffer, like a ring buffer does. The only way to reuse the memory assigning to this class
            is destroying it and creating a new page. This behavior is the key to have a simple push algorithm.
            Every push consumes some capacity. A consume has no effect on the capacity.
                - Both head and tail are monotonic: there is no wrapping at the end of the buffer
                - The capacity is monotonic: if an element does not fit in the available space, it will never do
            This class is non-copyable and non-movable.
