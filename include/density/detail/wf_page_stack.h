        /** \internal Wait-free concurrent stack of free pages.

            This class assumes that load, store, exchange and compare_exchange_weak on a std::atomic specializated on a
            pointer are wait-free.
            This is not a general purpose stack, it is rather designed and specialized to be used by the page manager.
            Any non-lifetime function of WF_PageStack is thread-safe and wait-free, but can fail in case of contention. Pop operations
            temporary lock the stack, so that any operation tried by the other threads will fail due to contention. This simplifies
            the implementation and makes the ABA problem harmless.
            \n WF_PageStack is not a strict stack: try_pop_unpinned removes the first unpinned page, if any.*/

                (possibly with one less page). Another benefit of this mechanism is that PageFooter::m_next does
                not need to be an atomic.
