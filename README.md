Density is a C++11 header-only library focused on paged memory management and concurrency, providing:

* efficient thread-local dynamic memory (see [lifo memory management](http://giucamp.github.io/density/doc/html/index.html#lifo)):
  - [lifo_array](http://giucamp.github.io/density/doc/html/classdensity_1_1lifo__array.html), an high-level container similar variable length arrays of to c99
  - [lifo_buffer](http://giucamp.github.io/density/doc/html/classdensity_1_1lifo__buffer.html), an untyped and resizable buffer 
  - [lifo_allocator](http://giucamp.github.io/density/doc/html/classdensity_1_1lifo__allocator.html), a low-level allocatotr that uses a page allocator to ptopvide LIFO memory management
* a toolkit of queues suitable for generic thread communication (see [heterogeneous queues and function queues](http://giucamp.github.io/density/doc/html/index.html#queues)):

## Documentation
The [overview](http://giucamp.github.io/density/doc/html/index.html) should be enough for an effective use of the library. Of course there is a [reference](http://giucamp.github.io/density/doc/html/annotated.html) (generated from the master branch) for the details. The documentation includes the results of some benchmarks. 

## Support
Supported compilers:
- Msc (Visual Studio 2017)
- g++-4.9 and g++-7
- clang++-4.0 and clang++-5.0

The current version has not been tested on achitectures with weak memory ordering, so relaxed atomic operations are disabled with a global compile-time constant. Future versions will exploit relaxed atomics. 

The library has an extensive test program that tests all the the data-structure, in normal and exceptional paths. The test program is executed on every commit in the master and develop branches. Anyway the current version is not mature enough for critical production code, and the coverage percentage reported by gcov and coveralls is biased due to some uninstantiated function templates. So: use it for your videogame, but not for heart surgery or landing a plane.

## How to...
To use the library, just download or clone the repository, and then copy the directory "density" in your include paths. The library is composed only by headers, so there is nothing to build. The directory doc contains the html documentation.

In the test directory there is a test program that you can build with cmake or Visual Studio 2017. Read [here](http://giucamp.github.io/density/doc/html/test_bench.html) for the details.

In the bench directory there is a benchmark program you you can build with cmake or Visual Studio 2017.

[This document](http://giucamp.github.io/density/doc/html/implementation.pdf) describes the implementation of the library.
